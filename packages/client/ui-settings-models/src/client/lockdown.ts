/**
 * Provider-configuration lockdown for the Models settings page.
 *
 * DEPLOYMENT POLICY (UI-only, by explicit decision): end users must not be
 * able to configure EXTERNAL LLM providers from this UI — every affordance
 * that would add or edit one renders disabled ("not clickable") — with a
 * single exception: an approved LOCAL LiteLLM gateway (an OpenAI-compatible
 * server on localhost, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:4000/v1`).
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT do:
 * - It does not change the backend. The `llm-pi-ai` settings schema, the
 *   settings-write gateway, and `settings.yaml` still accept every provider
 *   shape (openai-completions, openai-responses, anthropic-messages, catalog
 *   vendors, custom gateways). Those routes are kept fully functional so that
 *   administrator-provisioned configuration — the `settings.yaml` file on the
 *   host — keeps working unchanged. See the companion comments in
 *   `packages/llm/llm-pi-ai/src/{provider,catalog,config,index,discovery}.ts`.
 * - It does not hide administrator-provisioned rows. An external provider
 *   configured in `settings.yaml` still renders and still serves models; its
 *   Edit/Delete buttons are simply disabled here.
 *
 * Because the restriction lives in the client only, it is a UX guard, not a
 * security boundary: the settings API itself remains permissive by design.
